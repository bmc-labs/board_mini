**What should be the title of the page or section, of the example or showcase, of the _cool thing_?**
Every new thing needs a good title. Be descriptive and intuitive.

**Give a quick summary of the new content.**
Less than three sentences should suffice here. Separate into more than one submission if that is not enough.

**Why is this interesting?**
Of course you find it interesting, and we don't doubt that it is, but perhaps you have a very specific reason you want this included and we'd like to hear it!

**Provide the content itself.**
Please outline what you would like to see.

If it's text you're adding, this can be bullet points or the full article / page / section / ... Up to you.

If it's an example or showcase, please make sure you include

- [ ] the code (in the form of another GitHub/GitLab/... link preferably)
- [ ] screenshots (and/or screencaptures) of _cool thing_ in action
- [ ] a picture of the setup
- [ ] a simply wiring diagram
- [ ] a list of things necessary to build your project

**Additional Content**
Screenshots, screen captures, list of materials needed...
